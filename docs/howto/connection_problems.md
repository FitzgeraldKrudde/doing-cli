# How to fix connection problems

Some basic things to try:

- Make sure you are logged in to the azure devops environment on the browser as well (you need to go through the 2 factor authentication befor the command line interface works). You can do this using `az login`.
- Upgrade azure cli with `az upgrade` ([azure cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)).
- Disconnect from any company VPNs
- Try renewing your personal access token.
